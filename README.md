**Autopoietic Thoughtseed Emergence Simulation**
This project investigates the potential emergence of autopoietic thoughtseeds within a simulated system of interacting neurons. We define thoughtseeds as self-sustaining cognitive structures characterized by Markov Blanket properties.

**Conceptual Foundations**

**Autopoiesis:** Our work is grounded in the principles of autopoiesis, exploring how self-organizing and self-referential structures might arise from the dynamics of interconnected elements within a system.
**Markov Blankets:** We model thoughtseeds as possessing Markov Blanket properties, emphasizing statistical separation from their external environment while maintaining rich internal dynamics.
**Dynamical Systems Approach:** We employ a dynamical systems framework to analyze the behavior and evolution of our neuron system, focusing on attractors, stability, and the potential for emergent patterns.
**Neuronal Packet Hypothesis (NPH): **While inspired by concepts within the NPH, derived from **FEP** and **Active Inference**, our current emphasis is on the broader principles of autopoiesis and Markov Blanket characteristics in thoughtseed emergence. For information on NPH, see: (https://github.com/alec-tschantz/packets)
**Simulation Features (In Development) **
Later simulations will be adapted from Ant Colony Foraging https://github.com/docxology/ActiveInferAnts

**Neuron Model:**
Spiking behavior with configurable parameters.
Dynamic energy levels influencing activity and internal state.
Evolving identity beliefs shaped by energy and external influences.
Network Interactions: TBD
Research Goals

This project aims to:

**Identify conditions conducive to thoughtseed emergence:** Investigate how simulation parameters and network configurations influence the formation of self-organizing, self-referential structures.
**Characterize thoughtseed dynamics:** Analyze the stability, informational content, and interactions between potential thoughtseeds within the system.
**Contributions to thoughtseed theory:** Provide insights from the simulation to further the theoretical understanding of how autopoietic systems might give rise to complex cognitive structures.
**Future Directions**

**Learning mechanisms:** Introduce plasticity mechanisms to allow neuron behavior and connectivity to adapt based on activity patterns.
**Scaled-up Simulations:** Explore larger networks and more complex interactions.
**Stay Tuned!**

This project is currently under active development. We'll update this README with more detailed usage instructions, analysis tools, and visualizations as the simulation progresses.
